##External libraries
wsabi depends on some external library code (for grid layout, etc.). Whenever possible, that code is referenced as an external Xcode project. 
	* In order to get Xcode to find the headers, we need to add the project's Classes directory to the User Header Search Paths within the Build Settings for the wsabi2 target. 
	* We then need to set Xcode's Always Search User Paths option to "Yes"
	* Finally, we need to add the output from the external project to the "Link Binary With Libraries" option in the Build Phases section of the wsabi2 target.

##Technical Debt
Here's some outstanding stuff that should really be fixed.
    * The WSCDPerson->WSCDItem relationship should be ordered to reflect the fact that the items are, conceptually, ordered. However, there's a longstanding bug in Apple's Core Data code which makes this impractical for the time being ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7385439/problems-with-nsorderedset)). It's my feeling that a custom overridden setter for an autogenerated property is uglier than just including some sort of index in the data model itself.
