##External libraries
wsabi has references to the following external libraries  

* [GMGridView](https://github.com/gmoledina/GMGridView)  
	* MODIFICATION NOTE: GMGridView.m has been modified to prevent automatic deletion without confirmation.
* [ActionSheetPicker](FillThis)
    * MODIFICATION NOTE: Added a "neverPresentInPopover" variable to AbstractActionSheetPicker to prevent launching a popover from inside another popover (which is against the iPad HIG)
* [ELCTextFieldCell](https://github.com/elc/ELCTextFieldCell)
    * MODIFICATION NOTE: Had to update this for ARC compatibility
    
##Technical Debt
Here's some outstanding stuff that should really be fixed.  
    * The WSCDPerson->WSCDItem relationship should be ordered to reflect the fact that the items are, conceptually, ordered. However, there's a longstanding bug in Apple's Core Data code which makes this impractical for the time being ([source](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7385439/problems-with-nsorderedset)). It's my feeling that a custom overridden setter for an autogenerated property is uglier than just including some sort of index in the data model itself.
